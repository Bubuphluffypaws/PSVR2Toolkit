Unofficial modification for the official PlayStation VR2 driver/app.

## Features
- Eye tracking\*
- 10-bit color depth\*
- Improved controller prediction
- Improved controller haptics (w/ PCM haptics)
- Adaptive triggers

For developers, we also have our own API library, which allows you to take full advantage of these features.

\* Eye tracking calibration is closed source and is not available to the public in source form, other than official PlayStation VR2 Toolkit releases.

\* 10-bit color depth is broken on AMD GPUs newer than RDNA2/RX6000-series, due to an issue with AMD's LiquidVR, which is out of our control.

## Installation Guide
1.) Open Steam, go to the PS VR2 app, click on the cog wheel, and go to "Manage -> Browse local files". (If you are using a copy of the PS VR2 app not installed by Steam, go to that instead.)

2.) Inside the newly opened file explorer, go into "SteamVR_Plug-In", then "bin" and finally "win64".

3.) Rename "driver_playstation_vr2.dll" to "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll" (**IT MUST BE CALLED "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll", DO NOT RENAME IT TO ANYTHING ELSE, IT MUST BE EXACTLY THAT**)

4.) Download the "driver_playstation_vr2.dll" attached below this message, and copy/move it into the same folder where "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll" is at.

5.) Your "win64" directory should now have 2 DLL files inside it, "driver_playstation_vr2.dll" and "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll". If you do not have both of those files, you fucked something up.

6.) Enjoy your new features, please give us feedback in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dPsfJhsGwb).
